    <h2>Alexander Hansen</h2>
    <p>Hello I am Alex. Im 19 currently in Arizona, USA. I spend to much time playing video games but also working. Not married but definitely on the look out.</p>
    <p>I work at In N Out and i love my job so much i decided to stay online instead of going in person with my sister.
    Theres a chance that might change though.</p> 
    <p>I want to join the Air Force as an officer an make bank hahaha.</p>
    <p>I chose to take Computer programming and Web Design because they are always needed by compannies and are extremely versitile.
    I have absolutley zero experiance in either besides pathways so this will be a fun experiance.</p>
    I did not serve a mission but i had an experience that made me feel my decission was the right one so i have no regrets. You can ask me about it :)</p>
