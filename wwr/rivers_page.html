                Our first and most impressive attraction is The Grand Canyon. It has breathtaking views,
                amazing scenery, and different levels of rafting difficulty. We have rapids that are sutible to everyone:
                small children up to expirienced rafters. Did you know that The Grand Canyon is 6 million years old?
                On your trip you will be looking back in time as the river cuts through the earth through erosion. Don't get too
                excited just yet, the fun has yet to begin. Click the 'Book' button on our home page and select Grand Canyon to 
                start your rafting adventure! The rest of this text is just to prove that it wraps around the image.
